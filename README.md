Computer Science Coursework (GCSE)

This is my Computer Science OCR Coursework for GCSE, however due to Covid it was not officially turned in.
I worked on this for a good 3 months, some parts still may not work.

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to put the official document here since it is an official coursework document,
so I'll just paste the product requirements below.

# Client Brief
The client, Katrina, would like me to create a two-player dice game. The game must have 5 rounds and allow the two players to each roll two six-sided dice each round. The number the player rolls will be added to their score, along with 10 additional points if the total is an even number. However, if the number is odd, 5 points will be taken away from the player’s score. At any point, the player’s score must not go below zero. At the end of the 5 rounds, the player with the highest total score will win. If the scores are tied, another round will be played. This process will repeat until a clear winner is found. Only players who are authorised must be able to play the game, and user input must be validated where appropriate.

# Success Criteria
- The game must allow two players.
- The game must only allow authorised players.
- The game must allow both players to roll two six-sided dice.
- The game must calculate both players’ score at the end of each round.
- The game must allow the players to play 5 rounds.
- The game must allow the players to play an extra round if the score is a draw.
- The game must output the winner at the end of the game.
- The game must store the winner’s name and score in an external file.
- The game must display the score and player name of the top 5 winning scores from the external file.
